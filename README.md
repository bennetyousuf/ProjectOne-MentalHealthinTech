# ProjectOne-MentalHealthinTech
This is the main repository for Group 4 and our investigation of mental health in the tech industry

In this project, we were tasked with finding, cleaning, and analyzing a set of data of our choosing.

After analyzing the data, we use a variety of different dependencies to plot and vizualize our findings.

We chose to use the 2017 - 2020 OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey to determine how employees percieve their mental health as being supported by their employers.

We will do this by answering the following questions:

    1.How many employers provide mental health benefits?

    2.What level of comfort do people have discussing mental health with their employers?

    3.Do those that identify as having a mental disorder feel as though they are being supported?
    
    4.What is the level of importance placed on mental health versus physical health by employers over time? 

    5.What is the level of importance on mental health placed by employers in the US vs other locations?
